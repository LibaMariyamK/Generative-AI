He prepares to undertake the Hajj pilgrimage in his middle years on the insistence of his Christian wife Roselyn. Ali and his friend Aboobacker, a political leader, are on the verge of fallout over land acquisition from the locals for a harbour project. At the airport, the police arrest Ali under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA).\n",

They then intimidate Freddy, a juvenile arrested for throwing steel bombs at the police, into doing it. Freddy is the son of David Christudas, Roselyn's elder brother and Ali's nephew. David was a friend of Ali's but now holds a grudge against him.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the police's insistence, Ali's mother Jameela meets Freddy. In the 1960s, the Muslims and Christians of Ramadapally lived in harmony. The Christian fishermen community primarily lived in its Edavathura suburb. Ali, David, Peter and Hameed dropped out of school and engaged in petty crimes, working for Chandran, a local goon. Chandran disowned them after Ali sends trash dumped at the local mosque back to the disposers. Ali and his friends started smuggling on their own and he sets up his own shop.\n",

    "Ali's earnestness impressed the sub-collector Anwar Ali. Ali asked Anwar to clear the garbage dump and build a school there. Wanting to settle scores, Chandran sets fire to their godown and the children working there die. Ali kills Chandran in retaliation. Anwar questions Ali, who confesses to his crime, and challenges Anwar to arrest him before Ramadapally's residents. Forced to leave, Anwar extracted a promise from Jameela to testify against Ali. Jameela asks Freddy not to kill Ali and says he should be brought before the law. David and his wife visit Freddy in jail and Freddy enquires why David hates Ali.\n",

    "A look out notice was issued against Ali and he absconded to Minicoy, Lakshadweep along with David and Roselyn. Ali and Roselyn are married with David's approval. Ali gained Roselyn's approval to raise their children as Muslims. When David returned to the coast, David's father told him that the police beat their men and raped their women. Anwar told David that the Muslims reaped the benefits and the consequences were suffered by the coastal Christian fishermen. David was appalled but conflicted. He convinced Ali to appear before the court. Ali's mother gave a statement against Ali and he was remanded for three months. Roselyn gave birth to a boy who David named Antony and performed his baptism. When Ali is released, he interrupts the ritual and shouts at David. He names his son Ameer. David is aggrieved and ends his friendship with Ali.\"\"\"\n",
